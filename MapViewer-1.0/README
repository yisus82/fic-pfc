1. Software requirements
   ---------------------

   This software has been developed and tested with:
   
   * Operating system. It should be possible to compile and execute this
     distribution in Unix-like operating systems and any version of
     MS-Windows. In particular, I have tested the following combination:

     - MS Windows XP + PostgreSQL.
     
     All scripts are provided both in ".sh" and ".bat" files.
     
   * An implementation of J2SE 6.0. 

     I have used Sun's JDK 1.6.0 on MS-Windows.
     
   * JDOM 1.0
   	
   	 An XML Parser to manage de XML returned by the GetCapabilities request.
   
   * ant 1.6.5. 
   
     To manage the project (compile, generate JavaDoc, jars, and so on).
     
   * PostgreSQL 8.2. 
     
     I have used the following driver:
     
     - postgresql-8.3dev-600.jdbc4.jar (JDBC 3 driver) with PostgreSQL 8.2.
        
     The use of another relational database, assuming that provides a decent
     SQL, should be very easy. Probably it should only require to port SQL
     scripts for table creation and modify the configuration. Otherwise, 
     some interfaces should be implemented.
     
   * An application server conforming to Servlet 2.4, JSP 2.0 and EJB 3.0.

     I have used JBoss 4.2.1 GA.
     
   * An implementation of the JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL) 1.1.

     I have used Jakarta Standard TagLibs 1.1.2.

   * Jakarta Struts 1.3.5.
   
   	 A Model-View-Controller framework for JSP.

   * To read the sources, you should use a text editor configured with
     *tab size* to *four* blanks.
     
2. Basic installation and configuration of software packages
   ---------------------------------------------------------
   
   Most software packages needed by Map Viewer are very easy to install
   and configure for development. However, some of them must be installed with
   care. In this section it is commented how to do a basic installation and
   configuration of such packages. Check section 3 for environment variables
   when needed.
   
   2.4 Basic installation and configuration of JBoss
   	   ---------------------------------------------

   - You must have write permissions on the directory (and the
     files/subdirectories it contain) server/default.
     
   - Configure JBoss for it to be able to connect to PostgreSQL server.
   
     * Copy docs/examples/jca/postgres-ds.xml server/default/deploy
     * Modify server/default/deploy/postgres-ds.xml as follows:
       
<datasources>
  <local-tx-datasource>
    <jndi-name>PostgreSQLDS</jndi-name>
    <connection-url>jdbc:postgresql://localhost/postgres</connection-url>
    <driver-class>org.postgresql.Driver</driver-class>
    <user-name>postgres</user-name>
    <password>postgreSQL</password>
        <!-- sql to call when connection is created.  Can be anything, select 1 is valid for PostgreSQL -->
        <new-connection-sql>select 1</new-connection-sql>

        <!-- sql to call on an existing pooled connection when it is obtained from pool.  Can be anything, select 1 is valid for PostgreSQL -->
        <check-valid-connection-sql>select 1</check-valid-connection-sql>

      <!-- corresponding type-mapping in the standardjbosscmp-jdbc.xml (optional) -->
      <metadata>
         <type-mapping>PostgreSQL 8.2</type-mapping>
      </metadata>
  </local-tx-datasource>

</datasources>

      * Copy PosgreSQL JDBC driver to server/default/lib.


3. Building and initialization of the database
   ------------------------------------------------------

   You may need to adapt some of the below files. You need to adapt
   CommonProperties.xml and ../Scripts/CommonEnvironmentVariables.{sh, bat}.
      
   - CommonProperties.xml. Go to "Development environment" and "Development
     environment options" sections and follow instructions.
     
   - ../Scripts/CommonEnvironmentVariables.{sh, bat}. Go to "Run-time 
   	 system" section and follow instructions.
   	 
   - ../PropertiesConfiguration/ConfigurationParameters.properties
   
   - ../PropertiesConfiguration/ServiceLocatorJNDIInitialContext.properties

   - MapViewer/Sources/HTMLView/WEB-INF/web.xml
   
   - MapViewer/Sources/EJBConfiguration/persistence.xml
   
   Finally, start the database and execute:
   
   ant all initdb
   
   During execution of target "initdb" you will see a number of SQL errors 
   reported by ant whenever a DROP sentence is executed. This is normal 
   since MapViewer SQL scripts drop tables and sequences before creating 
   them, which causes errors when such tables or sequences don't exist yet.
